Dear Sasha,

Marius produced the numbers for Mh=400 GeV:

#chan  m_H  sigma(pb)    rel_of_tot(%)   pert_err         PDF_err
tot:   400  0.0012925       100.0       - 5.0  +2.8
0-b:   400  0.0006710        51.9       - 7.2  +8.9     -6.7  +7.6 
1-b:   400  0.0005514        42.6       - 8.9  +5.8     -6.4  +6.4
2-b:   400  0.0000811         6.3       -28.4 +45.5     -4.5  +4.4

and here is an update of the numbers for Mh=140 GeV 
(the scale error changed a bit):
#chan  m_H  sigma(pb)  rel_of_tot(%)     pert_err
tot:   140  0.1088526       100.0       - 8.0  +3.3
0-b:   140  0.0694588        63.81      -14.4  +8.8
1-b:   140  0.0357700        32.86      - 6.9  +4.4
2-b:   140  0.0045400         4.17      -33.1 +59.0

We'll send you the distributions later this week.

Cheers,
Robert
