Hi Sasha,

I've made a small recipe for this - it should work with 5_3_X releases (i tested on 5_3_4).

To get all the new tau discriminators you need to update these packages:

cvs co -r V01-04-17 RecoTauTag/RecoTau
cvs co -r V01-04-03 RecoTauTag/Configuration
cvs co -r V00-04-01 CondFormats/EgammaObjects

I put a minimal config on cvs:

http://cmssw.cvs.cern.ch/cgi-bin/cmssw.cgi/UserCode/ICHiggsTauTau/test/tauMETExample_cfg.py?revision=1.2&view=markup

Where you can see running the HPS PF tau sequence and the type-1 met sequence is fairly straightforward.  The tau sequence here actually re-makes the PF Tau collection, which is not strictly necessary in 53X, but I couldn't find a simpler way to get the extra discriminators to run.

To access the tau discriminators you can look the example Producer here:

No PAT anywhere!

cheers,
Andrew
